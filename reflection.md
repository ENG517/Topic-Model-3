# An Introduction to Stardew Valley: Reflection

# User Scenario 1: The Absolute Beginner 

The user in this scenario is about to play stardew valley for the very first time. They opened up to the “create a new save” screen and were immediately overwhelmed by the amount of choices and the lack of direction available to them. Their first goal is to create a character that they really like, and won’t have to make changes to later in the game.

Once they have done this, they also want to set their farm up for success. They have some experience playing other simulation games and know the importance of making a strong profit at the start of the game, so they want to make sure that they are making choices that will set them up for success while also learning the ins and outs of the new mechanics.

This map is at once comprehensive and targeted to the user. To assist the user with their first goal, the intro-to-new-saves concept provides them with some grounding information that is expanded upon in the following reference, before diving into creating the required traits.  We decided to remove the information about the various farms from this section, and point the user to only using the standard farm to start since the non-standard farm types are designed to allow users to focus on building up a certain skill, which may confuse or frustrate a novice. For the farming section, we removed the section about the seed maker, since it is something that can only be crafted once you have reached level 9 in farming and thus is not relevant to getting started. Other information that is excluded from this version are tips about using upgraded technology later in the game such as sprinklers to help the user stay on track with just starting their farm.

# User Scenario 2: Farming Spring Crops

The idea behind this user scenario, is that a user is a complete novice and has never played “Stardew Valley” before. However, they have been recommended the game by friends who play it. Our user is also new to gaming in general, and has never played a farming simulation game, but they have played a few open ended RPGs so they understand some aspects of these types of games, of which “Stardew Valley” is one. This user's goal is to learn about the mechanics of “Stardew Valley” to see if it is a good level of difficulty for them, as well as to see if the variability of in-game options and NPC engagement is similar to the previous RPGs they have played.

Since the user is interested mostly in the mechanics, we wanted to point them to the farming information first and foremost. The concepts for Pierre's and JojaMart will help them to learn about the NPC interaction that interests them, as well as begin to build an understanding of the interaction mechanics. We did not filter out the information about seed makers, or any extraneous tips since this user is seeking as much information as possible before commiting to the purchase, not trying to use the document side-by-side with the game like the user in scenario 1.

We also chose to keep the two maps separate in this scenario as the information about creating a character and the farm options is secondary to the goal of learning game mechanics. However, we included it as we felt that the user may want to quickly skim some of the information if they felt the mechanics explained in the first map were suitable to their skill level.

# User Scenario 3: Returning Player

This player has experience playing “Stardew Valley” and has recently decided to restart the game. They know what they’re doing, but want to see if there are any tips and tricks they can use to improve their ability to farm crops and earn more money. They don’t really need help setting up their character, creating required traits, etc but they could use some ideas for setting up their farm, farming in spring, using the seed make, and other more complicated aspects of the game. When starting the game, they notice a new version has been released since they last played, and they see more farm types have been added. They want to make sure they understand farming processes to get the most out of this new update.

Because our user has played before, we filtered out some of the concepts, reference tables, and tasks that are more beginner oriented. However, because of this user's interest in beginning a game where they focus more on farming and seek to improve their farming skills and output, we left in all concepts, reference tables, and tasks pertaining to farming and seed, minus those that they would already be familiar with (buying seeds, tools, energy).
