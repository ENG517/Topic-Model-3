            <cmd>Choose the characterâ€™s sex.</cmd>
            <info>Tip: It is best to select this first as the clothing and hair styles will change if you decide to switch the sex of your character later.</info>
            <info>FYI: While selecting a character's sex will change the starting selections for the character's hair and outfit, all preset options are available regardless of the character's sex.</info>

            <cmd>Select the color of your avatar's eyes, shirt and pants using hue, lightness and darkness sliders.</cmd>
            <info>Tip: Its best to think of the color selection process like mixing paint with set amounts of paint. First you pick the base color, then you can mix in white and/or black to change the shade. The number next to the color selection slider shows the base you have selected. The number next to the other two displays the percentage of base color in the final shade.</info>
