## Buying Seeds
Before you can plant any crops, you must first have the seeds for the desired crop. There are three different ways to acquire seeds:
### Method 1: Pierre's General Store (Recommended)
Pierre's General Store has the best prices for seeds from the start of the game, so it is the best option for early game farming.
1. Walk to Pierre's General Store and right-click the door to enter.

2. Approach Pierre, but stay behind the counter. If you approach Pierre from the same side of the counter, you will start a dialogue, or give him a gift rather than accessing the shop catalogue.

3.Right click on Pierre to bring up his shop catalogue.
  
1. Scroll to find and select the plants you wish to grow.
   
   *Tip: If you hover over the seed you can see the growing details, such as what season you can plant the crop in, and how long it will take to grow.*

2. Right-click to purchase one packet of seeds. Each packet will grow one plant of that type. 
   > You can buy multiples of 5 by holding Shift + right- or left-click, multiples of 25 by holding Control + Shift + right- or left-click, or a full stack of 999 by holding Control + Shift + 1 + left-click. Once you click, the money will automatically leave your inventory.
   
### Method 2: Joja Mart
Joja Mart, while more expensive than Pierre's, has longer open hours in the game. They are a good alternative in a pinch. 
> **Warning:** If you buy a membership, the prices will decrease, but this will have an impact on later game play.
 
1. Walk to Joja Mart and right-click the door to enter.

2. Approach the cashier. 
3. From across the check out counter right click on the cashier to bring up the shop catalogue.

4. Scroll to find and select the plants you wish to grow. 
   > **Note:** The Joja Brand items will always be displayed before the seeds.
5. Right-click to purchase one packet of seeds. Each packet will grow one plant of that type. 
   > You can buy multiples of 5 by holding Shift + right- or left-click, multiples of 25 by holding Control + Shift + right- or left-click, or a full stack of 999 by holding Control + Shift + 1 + left-click. Once you click, the money will automatically leave your inventory.
