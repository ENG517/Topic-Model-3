## Harvesting and Selling the Crops
Once the growing period has passed, you will be able to harvest your crops. To check if they are ready, hover your cursor over the crops. If a plus sign pops up next to your usual cursor, the crops are ready to harvest.

1. Hover over the crop you wish to harvest. Right-click to pick the crop. Repeat until you have harvested all the ready crops.
    > **Note:** Some crops will require a scythe to harvest. You will receive an error message in the bottom left corner if this is the case.
   * If the crop did not immediately enter your inventory, you may have been too far away. You should see a crop sitting on the ground.
   *  If you are unable to harvest the crop, your inventory may be full. Remove some items and try again.

   > **Note:** Some crops will continue to produce for the whole season once they reach maturity. These crops will give you a drop when you harvest, but the plant will stay in the square.

2. Walk over to the shipping bin you were provided at the start of the game. Right-click the bin to open it.

3. Right click on the crops in your inventory. They should populate in the square of the bin's selling window, and you should hear a thudding sound.

    >**Warning:** You can only reclaim items from the bin if you do so immediately after putting them in. If you add another item, or close the bin you will not be able to retrieve the sold item.

4. Repeat until all crops have been sold.
   
You will receive the money for the crops that you sold at the beginning of the next day.
> **Tip:** Don't sell all of your crops, especially high quality ones. You may need them for future quests and events.
