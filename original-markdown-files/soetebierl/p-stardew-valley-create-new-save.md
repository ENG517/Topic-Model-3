<!-- OVERALL COMMENTS
  - Most of my comments can be found in situ denoted by the "COMMENT" tag. Many of these you can extrapolate and apply elsewhere across your file and other files.
  - Coaching Moves: See my in situ comments mainly, but overall I note how to consider some different verbs as a means to revision for concision, as well as how to move some step info into alerting moves/formatting.
  - Alerting Moves: 
    - Be consistent in your delivery/formatting. While we did not spend a lot of time with Markdown's styling capabilities, you had varied approaches and names for your alerting moves. When you complete your draft, review it for the different types of alerts, then you can account for them and make sure they are all consistent across the docs.
  - Figures/Images: You should crop some images that do not need to be full screen UI in size. For example, with the character creation, if you provide an initial UI context in a prior step, you can then use cropped versions in reference to particular UI controls, like the respective name fields for the character and farm.

# Creating a New Save in Stardew Valley

Part of the charm of Stardew Valley is the ability to customize your farm to your liking, however with little to no direction the character creation and farm selection process can be a bit intimidating. This set of instructions aims to demystify this process so that you can have the character and farm set from the get go!

There is no set order that these steps need to be completed in, the following order is just a suggestion. Alterations can be made at anytime. <!--Is this last statement correct? YOu note in places how you cannot change it after setting it. -->

<!-- > **Note:** This tutorial is intended only for a single player game of Stardew Valley Version 1.6 on PC. -->

## Pre-Requisites

  Simplified your content a bit.
  - Removed the above note, as it is a prereq, and
  - Removed aspects that can be assumed, such as installation. If someone is seeking a tutorial about X, can I assume that they have completed some steps (installed SDV) and have some software (e.g., Steam).

You can skip character customization and begin play after filling in the required character traits: name, farm name, and favorite thing.

**Warning:** Once you start game play you will be unable to make alterations to your farm and character, except with the Shrine of Illusions. *See [Altering Options in Game](#) for more information.*

  <!-- COMMENT: 
    Is this a step result, or is that red X the new button? It's unclear, unless you already have played the game. (I haven't. Ahhh! I feel bad about that. lol)

    That said, I sense that its best to provide the New button here, rather than the step result on the first step.

<!-- 1. Type the name you want for your character into the "Name" field. This is the name that your character will have for the entire game, and will be how the NPCs refer to you. -->
<!-- COMMENT:
  - Coaching verbs can be unassuming in their nuance. Note how even Type vs. Enter can (1) be slightly more specific, and (2) help simplify the overall action to create a more concise step.
  - Also, be sure to separate those alerting moves more consistently throughout
  - Apply this feedback throughout
-->
2. Enter your character's name into the "Name" field. 
  * **Warning**: Your cannot change your character's name.

4. Add in something to serve as your favorite thing. Your favorite thing has no impact on game play, but is simply a way for you to add another level of personality to your character!

5. Select your animal preference from the options. This will determine what your first pet will be. There will be the opportunity to acquire a different pet later in the game.

## Selecting a Farm Type
There are eight different farm settings available to choose from in Stardew Valley 1.6.

<!-- COMMENT:
  - This list is fine for the purposes of this assignment, but I would have recommended a reference table with a description/summary column next to a "Type of Farm" column.
-->
**The Farm types are as follows:**
   * Standard Farm
   * Beach Farm
   * Riverland Farm
   * Meadowlands Farm
   * Forest Farm
   * Hill-Top Farm
   * Wilderness Farm
   * Four Corners Farm

<img src="assets\images\screenshots\farm-type-list.png" alt="This displays the list of all farm types available for selection in the game." style="width: 300px"> 


> **Warning**: You will not be able to alter the farm type once you have started this game. 
 
**To select your farm type:**
1. Hover over the icons of each farm type for a general description of each farm type.
If you want to learn the specific associated stats of each farm see the [Farm Maps Page](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Farm_Maps) on the [Stardew Valley Wiki](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Stardew_Valley_Wiki)

      <img src="assets\images\screenshots\standard-farm-hover.png" alt="The mouse is hovering over the icon for the standard farm and a short description has opened. The description says A simple plot of land with a large amount of open space to design your farm." style="width: 300px">  <img src="assets\images\screenshots\hilltop-farm-hover.png" alt="The mouse is hovering over the icon for the hilltop farm and a short description has opened. The description says Rocky terrain and a winding river make it difficult to design your farm. However, a mineral deposit provides mining opportunities." style="width: 300px"> 

1. Click to select that type of farm. A red box will appear to indicate that your selection has gone through.

## Character Design
Designing your character is the portion of the set-up process with the most customization. While the physical features of the characters have rigid presets, you are able to select the exact colors of certain features. 

### Pre-Set Selection
1. Choose the characterâ€™s sex. It is best to select this first as the clothing and hair styles will change if you decide to switch the sex of your character later.
   > While selecting a character's sex will change the starting selections for the character's hair and outfit, all preset options are available regardless of the character's sex.

2. Click the arrows to flip through all set appearance options for **Skin Color**, **Hair Style**, **Shirt**, **Pants**, and **Accents**.
  <img src="assets\images\screenshots\preset-options.png" alt="This is the list of preset options for character elements. All are set to default option 1." style="width: 300px">

    <!-- * Skin color
    * Hair style
    * Shirt
    * Pants
    * Accents

      <img src="assets\images\screenshots\preset-options.png" alt="This is the list of preset options for character elements. All are set to default option 1." style="width: 300px">  -->

The number in the middle of the arrows will change to indicate which option you have selected.

> If you are not satisfied with the outfit options, you will be able to craft and but other clothes in the game. See "Changing Options in Game" for more information.

### Select the color of each feature
The eye, shirt, and pants colors are determined using hue, lightness and darkness sliders. 

<img src="assets\images\screenshots\color-slider.png" alt="A close up of the color selection sliders." style="width: 300px">

> **Tip:** Its best to think of the color selection process like mixing paint with set amounts of paint. First you pick the base color, then you can mix in white and/or black to change the shade. The number next to the color selection slider shows the base you have selected. The number next to the other two displays the percentage of base color in the final shade. 
>
> The screenshot above shows that the base color is red (3) and the final color has 57% of the total white mixed in, and 47% of the total black mixed in.

1. Slide the cursor of the top, rainbow colored bar to select the color family you want for this feature (i.e. red, orange, yellow, green, blue, etc.
2. Slide the cursor of the middle bar to adjust the amount of white in the final color. 
3. Slide the cursor of the bottom bar to adjust the amount of black in the final color.

## Changing Options in Game
Clothes can be acquired by: 
* Purchasing or earning them at festivals
* Finding them in treasure drops in the mines
* Using cloth and the sewing machine to make new garments

Clothes can be changed at any time in the player menu.

The [Shrine of Illusions](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/The_Shrine_of_Illusions) can be used to change your character's:
 * Character Name
 * Skin
 * Hair & Hair Color
 * Eye Color
 * Accents
 * Favorite thing 
 * Gender 
> **All other features selected during this stage are permanent.**

## Optional: Altering Game Options
On this screen there is also an option for you to view the "Advanced Game Options" by selecting the wrench icon in the bottom left corner.

<img src="assets\images\screenshots\game-op-icon.png" alt="Wrench icon for advanced game options " style="width: 200px">

This will allow you to change certain settings to make the game more or less difficult to suit your level of experience. Items you can are shown in the images below:
<img src="assets\images\screenshots\game-op-page-1.png" alt="Advanced game options: Alter community center bundle; guarantee year 1 completable, alter mine rewards, spawn monsters on the farm" style="width: 500px"> <img src="assets\images\screenshots\game-op-page-2.png" alt="Advanced game options: profit margins, Multiplayer options (starting cabins, cabin layout) random seed" style="width: 500px">
  
>**Note:** This is not recommended for new players. When you select your farm, the game settings will be set to the ideal default for that particular type of farm, so no further action is needed.

* Character Name
