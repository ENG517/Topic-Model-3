# User Scenario - Planting and Harvesting Crops in Stardew Valley

**Scenario**: Anna has never played Stardew Valley before, but has been recommended the game by friends. They are pretty new to gaming, and have never played a farming simulation game before, but have played and enjoyed a few open ended RPGs.

Their goal is to learn more about the mechanics of the game to see if Stardew Valley is an appropriate difficulty for them. They also want to see if the variability in game options, and NPC engagement is similar to the RPGs they've played in the past.
