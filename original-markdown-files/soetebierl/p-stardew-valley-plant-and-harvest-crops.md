  > The small plants, such as those two squares above the farmer are a part of the texture of the land and will not impact farming. They cannot be removed.
* Required Items:
  * Hoe
  * Watering Can
  * Gold coins (if purchasing seeds)

* Optional Items:
  * Sprinklers
  * Fertilizer
  * Scythe

## Acquiring Seeds
Before you can plant any crops, you must first have the seeds for the desired crop. There are three different ways to acquire seeds:
### Method 1: Pierre's General Store (Recommended)
Pierre's General Store has the best prices for seeds from the start of the game, so it is the best option for early game farming.
1. Walk to Pierre's General Store and right-click the door to enter. 

   <img src="assets\images\screenshots\pierre-store-and-counter.png" alt="A side-by side view of Pierre's general store from the outside, and inside" style="width: 700px">

2. Approach Pierre, but stay behind the counter. If you approach Pierre from the same side of the counter, you will start a dialogue, or give him a gift rather than accessing the shop catalogue.

3.Right click on Pierre to bring up his shop catalogue. 
  
1. Scroll to find and select the plants you wish to grow.
   
   *Tip: If you hover over the seed you can see the growing details, such as what season you can plant the crop in, and how long it will take to grow.*
   
   <img src="assets\images\screenshots\pierre-purchase-menu.png" alt="The purchase menu from pierre's showing starter spring crops." style="width: 700px">
2. Right-click to purchase one packet of seeds. Each packet will grow one plant of that type. 
   > You can buy multiples of 5 by holding Shift + right- or left-click, multiples of 25 by holding Control + Shift + right- or left-click, or a full stack of 999 by holding Control + Shift + 1 + left-click. Once you click, the money will automatically leave your inventory.
   
### Method 2: Joja Mart
Joja Mart, while more expensive than Pierre's, has longer open hours in the game. They are a good alternative in a pinch. 
> **Warning:** If you buy a membership, the prices will decrease, but this will have an impact on later game play.
 
1. Walk to Joja Mart and right-click the door to enter.

2. Approach the cashier. 
3. From across the check out counter right click on the cashier to bring up the shop catalogue.
   <img src="assets\images\screenshots\joja-mart-purchase-menu.png" alt="The purchase menu from Joja Mart showing starter spring crops." style="width: 700px">
4. Scroll to find and select the plants you wish to grow. 
   > **Note:** The Joja Brand items will always be displayed before the seeds.
5. Right-click to purchase one packet of seeds. Each packet will grow one plant of that type. 
   > You can buy multiples of 5 by holding Shift + right- or left-click, multiples of 25 by holding Control + Shift + right- or left-click, or a full stack of 999 by holding Control + Shift + 1 + left-click. Once you click, the money will automatically leave your inventory.

### Method 3: Seed Maker
Later in the game you will gain access to crafting a seed maker. This will allow you to use crops that you have to create seeds at no extra cost.

<img src="assets\images\screenshots\craft-seed-maker.jpg" alt="Recipe for crafting a seed maker." style="width: 300px">


1. Equip one or more of the crop you wish to turn to seeds.
2. Approach the Seed Maker. Right-click with the crop in your hand.
3. Wait a few moments, a pop-up will appear on top of the seed maker.

4. Left-click to collect the finished seeds. 

## Preparing the Land
The first step to planting is tilling the land. This will cost you energy, so keep an eye on your energy meter found in the bottom right hand corner of the screen.

1. Equip your hoe. 
2. Aim by using the arrow keys to turn your character's body in the direction that you want to till. Right-click and hover to select the square you want to till.
3. Release your mouse when you are satisfied with your selection of square. This will result in the ground turning darker than before to indicate that it has been tilled.
<img src="assets\images\screenshots\tilling-land.png" alt="A player is using their hoe to till the land. Tilled squares appear a darker brown." style="width: 300px">
4. (Optional) Add in your fertilizer.
5. (Optional) Place a sprinkler in the square adjacent to the tilled dirt.

> See "Sprinklers and Fertilizer at the end of the tutorial for more information on steps 4 & 5.
6. Repeat until you have tilled enough squares for all of your seeds.
   
## Planting the Crops
1. Equip the seeds of the crop that you want to plant.
2. Right click on the tilled squares to plant the seed. The scattered seeds should appear on the dirt. Repeat until you have planted all the seeds.

3. Equip the watering can. Right-click on all the freshly planted seeds to water them.

## Maintaining the Crops
In order for your crops to grow, they must be watered on a daily basis until they are ready to harvest. If you miss a day of watering, your crops will not die, but they also will not progress to the next stage of growth.

Your watering can will eventually run out of water. To fill it:
1. Approach any body of water and use your arrow keys to aim.
2. Left click to fill the can.

<img src="assets\images\screenshots\fill-can.png" alt="The player is filling their watering can." style="width: 300px">

> **Note:** You do not need to water the crops on rainy days, like in the image below.

## Harvesting and Selling the Crops
Once the growing period has passed, you will be able to harvest your crops. To check if they are ready, hover your cursor over the crops. If a plus sign pops up next to your usual cursor, the crops are ready to harvest.

<br>

1. Hover over the crop you wish to harvest. Right-click to pick the crop. Repeat until you have harvested all the ready crops.
    > **Note:** Some crops will require a scythe to harvest. You will receive an error message in the bottom left corner if this is the case.
   * If the crop did not immediately enter your inventory, you may have been too far away. You should see a crop sitting on the ground.
   *  If you are unable to harvest the crop, your inventory may be full. Remove some items and try again.

   <img src="assets\images\screenshots\harvest-action.png" alt="The player is about to harvest their parsnips." style="width: 300px">
  
   > **Note:** Some crops will continue to produce for the whole season once they reach maturity. These crops will give you a drop when you harvest, but the plant will stay in the square.

2. Walk over to the shipping bin you were provided at the start of the game. Right-click the bin to open it.

   <img src="assets\images\screenshots\approach-bin.png" alt="The player is standing in front of their shipping bin." style="width: 300px">

3. Right click on the crops in your inventory. They should populate in the square of the bin's selling window, and you should hear a thudding sound. 

    <img src="assets\images\screenshots\parsnips-sold.png" alt="The player has sold their parsnips and they have populated in the sold box of the bin." style="width: 700px">

    >**Warning:** You can only reclaim items from the bin if you do so immediately after putting them in. If you add another item, or close the bin you will not be able to retrieve the sold item.

4. Repeat until all crops have been sold.
   
You will receive the money for the crops that you sold at the beginning of the next day.
> **Tip:** Don't sell all of your crops, especially high quality ones. You may need them for future quests and events.

## (Optional) Sprinklers and Fertilizer
While they are not necessary to grow crops, sprinklers and fertilizer make the process easier, and allow you to produce better crops. You begin being able to craft basic fertilizer. Using fertilizer will increase your chances at growing high quality crops. Fertilizer can also be purchase from Pierre's starting on Day 15 of Spring during Year 1.  

Sprinklers, however, can only be crafted and will be unlocked beginning when you reach farming level 2, with upgrades coming at later levels. Basic sprinklers will automatically water four adjacent crops, with its range increasing with upgrades.
