# User Scenario - Creating a New Save in Stardew Valley

**Scenario**: Alex has just made the decision to download the game, and is creating their first save. They are overwhelmed by the amount of options available for character customization and farm type. 

While they have never played Stardew Valley before, they have played other simulations and RPGs.

They aren’t sure where to start, or what all the questions they are being asked mean. Their goal is to create a character that they really like, and won’t have to make changes to later in the game. 

They also want to be sure that they pick a farm type that fits with their aesthetics, but doesn't make the game more or less difficult to play.
