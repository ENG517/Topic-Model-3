  <title>Customizing a New Character</title>
  <shortdesc>
    The "Designing Your Character" portion of the new save set-up process allows for the most customization. Some aspects of the character design phase allow for more freedom than others, for example physical characteristics of characters have rigid presents, but color selection allows for more freedom.

        <note type="tip">It's best to think of the color selection process like mixing paint with set amounts of paint. First you pick the base color, then you can mix in white and/or black to change the shade. The number next to the color selection slider shows the base you have selected. The number next to the other two displays the percentage of base color in the final shade</note>
