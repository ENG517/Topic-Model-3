# Avatar Customization (Renamed from OG procedure)
**This potentially could be two different tasks, but IDK; lmk what you think!**
Designing your character is the portion of the set-up process with the most customization. While the physical features of the characters have rigid presets, you are able to select the exact colors of certain features. 

### Pre-Set Selection
1. Choose the characterâ€™s sex. It is best to select this first as the clothing and hair styles will change if you decide to switch the sex of your character later.
   > While selecting a character's sex will change the starting selections for the character's hair and outfit, all preset options are available regardless of the character's sex.

2. Click the arrows to flip through all set appearance options for **Skin Color**, **Hair Style**, **Shirt**, **Pants**, and **Accents**.

    <!-- * Skin color
    * Hair style
    * Shirt
    * Pants
    * Accents

The number in the middle of the arrows will change to indicate which option you have selected.

> If you are not satisfied with the outfit options, you will be able to craft and but other clothes in the game. See "Changing Options in Game" for more information.

### Select the color of each feature
The eye, shirt, and pants colors are determined using hue, lightness and darkness sliders.

> **Tip:** Its best to think of the color selection process like mixing paint with set amounts of paint. First you pick the base color, then you can mix in white and/or black to change the shade. The number next to the color selection slider shows the base you have selected. The number next to the other two displays the percentage of base color in the final shade. 
>
> The screenshot above shows that the base color is red (3) and the final color has 57% of the total white mixed in, and 47% of the total black mixed in.

1. Slide the cursor of the top, rainbow colored bar to select the color family you want for this feature (i.e. red, orange, yellow, green, blue, etc.
2. Slide the cursor of the middle bar to adjust the amount of white in the final color. 
3. Slide the cursor of the bottom bar to adjust the amount of black in the final color.
