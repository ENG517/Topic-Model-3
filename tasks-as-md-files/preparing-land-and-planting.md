## Preparing the Land
The first step to planting is tilling the land. This will cost you energy, so keep an eye on your energy meter found in the bottom right hand corner of the screen.

1. Equip your hoe. 
2. Aim by using the arrow keys to turn your character's body in the direction that you want to till. Right-click and hover to select the square you want to till.
3. Release your mouse when you are satisfied with your selection of square. This will result in the ground turning darker than before to indicate that it has been tilled.

4. (Optional) Add in your fertilizer.
5. (Optional) Place a sprinkler in the square adjacent to the tilled dirt.

> See "Sprinklers and Fertilizer at the end of the tutorial for more information on steps 4 & 5.
6. Repeat until you have tilled enough squares for all of your seeds.
   
## Planting the Crops
1. Equip the seeds of the crop that you want to plant.
2. Right click on the tilled squares to plant the seed. The scattered seeds should appear on the dirt. Repeat until you have planted all the seeds.
