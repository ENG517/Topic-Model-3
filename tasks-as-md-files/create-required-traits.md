You can skip character customization and begin play after filling in the required character traits: name, farm name, and favorite thing.

**Warning:** Once you start game play you will be unable to make alterations to your farm and character, except with the Shrine of Illusions. *See [Altering Options in Game](#) for more information.*

  <!-- COMMENT: 
    Is this a step result, or is that red X the new button? It's unclear, unless you already have played the game. (I haven't. Ahhh! I feel bad about that. lol)

    That said, I sense that its best to provide the New button here, rather than the step result on the first step.

<!-- 1. Type the name you want for your character into the "Name" field. This is the name that your character will have for the entire game, and will be how the NPCs refer to you. -->
<!-- COMMENT:
  - Coaching verbs can be unassuming in their nuance. Note how even Type vs. Enter can (1) be slightly more specific, and (2) help simplify the overall action to create a more concise step.
  - Also, be sure to separate those alerting moves more consistently throughout
  - Apply this feedback throughout
-->
2. Enter your character's name into the "Name" field. 
  * **Warning**: Your cannot change your character's name.

4. Add in something to serve as your favorite thing. Your favorite thing has no impact on game play, but is simply a way for you to add another level of personality to your character!

5. Select your animal preference from the options. This will determine what your first pet will be. There will be the opportunity to acquire a different pet later in the game.

**I've grouped these together since they're required to play, and the farm one is too short to be on its own**
## Selecting a Farm Type
There are eight different farm settings available to choose from in Stardew Valley 1.6.

<!-- COMMENT:
  - This list is fine for the purposes of this assignment, but I would have recommended a reference table with a description/summary column next to a "Type of Farm" column.
-->
**The Farm types are as follows:**
   * Standard Farm
   * Beach Farm
   * Riverland Farm
   * Meadowlands Farm
   * Forest Farm
   * Hill-Top Farm
   * Wilderness Farm
   * Four Corners Farm
