## Maintaining the Crops
In order for your crops to grow, they must be watered on a daily basis until they are ready to harvest. If you miss a day of watering, your crops will not die, but they also will not progress to the next stage of growth.

Your watering can will eventually run out of water. To fill it:
1. Approach any body of water and use your arrow keys to aim.
2. Left click to fill the can.

> **Note:** You do not need to water the crops on rainy days, like in the image below.

## Harvesting and Selling the Crops
Once the growing period has passed, you will be able to harvest your crops. To check if they are ready, hover your cursor over the crops. If a plus sign pops up next to your usual cursor, the crops are ready to harvest.
