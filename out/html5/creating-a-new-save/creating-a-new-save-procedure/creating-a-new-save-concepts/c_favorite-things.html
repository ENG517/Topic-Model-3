      Your character's favorite thing is completely up to you, you can be as creative as you like. Your avatar's "Favorite Thing" comes into play when you find stardrops, which are little gems that give your avatar energy to boost their health and stamina. Other that stardrops, your "Favorite Thing" is occasionally brought up in dialogue with other characters.
